## Features

## Tech Stack  

- Modular Monorepo Architecture  
  Scalable multi-package structure (Physical decoupling, feature-driven isolation, and cross-project code reuse)    
- Clean Architecture  
  Layered software design (Independent domain logic, high testability, and strict separation of concerns)    
- Melos  
  Enterprise-grade monorepo management (Automated bootstrapping, cross-package script execution, and versioning)  
- Freezed  
  Robust Data Modeling & Immutability (Automated copyWith, union types for state handling, and compile-time data safety)    
- BLoC  
  Predictable State Management (Unidirectional data flow, strict separation of UI from business logic, and event-driven architecture)    
- Get_it  
  Centralized Service Locator (Decoupled component lifecycles, global instance management, and highly testable dependency access)
